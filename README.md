# protobounce

This is *protobounce*, a set of microservices to connect to IRC and do stuff.
This is either a really good idea or a really awful idea, and I haven't figured
out which one.

## Motivation

I realized my [IRC library](https://github.com/watchtower/asyncirc) was poorly
designed to the point where it was basically untestable.
[@sdamashek](https://github.com/sdamashek) suggested that I "use a client-server
model using protobufs." We agreed that such a model could have some interesting
applications, so, here we are.

## Design

haha, good one.

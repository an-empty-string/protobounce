## protobounce

This is *protobounce*, a set of microservices to connect to IRC and do stuff.
This is either a really good idea or a really awful idea, and I haven't figured
out which one.

### Motivation

I realized my [IRC library](https://github.com/watchtower/asyncirc) was poorly
designed to the point where it was basically untestable. I mentioned this on
IRC, and @sdamashek said I should make something with `protobufs` and/or `gRPC`.

So, here we are.

### Design

haha, good one.
